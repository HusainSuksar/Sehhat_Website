## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **1. Enhanced View Logic**

```python
def create_appointment(request, doctor_id=None):
    # Enhanced patient assignment with proper error handling
    if not appointment.patient:
        if request.user.role == 'patient':
            # Auto-create patient profile if needed
            patient_profile = Patient.objects.create(
                user=request.user,
                date_of_birth=date(1990, 1, 1),
                gender='other'
            )
            appointment.patient = patient_profile
        
        # Final validation with clear error message
        if not appointment.patient:
            messages.error(request, 'Please enter a valid ITS ID and click "Fetch"')
```

### **2. Enhanced Template with Fetch Button**

```html
<div class="its-lookup-container">
    {{ form.patient_its_id }}
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm fetch-button" id="fetchPatientBtn">
        <span id="fetchBtnText">Fetch</span>
        <div class="loading-spinner d-none" id="fetchSpinner"></div>
    </button>
</div>

<!-- Success/Error Alerts -->
<div class="alert-custom alert-success" id="fetchSuccessAlert">
    <i class="fas fa-check-circle me-2"></i>
    <span id="fetchSuccessMessage"></span>
</div>
```

### **3. JavaScript Functionality**

```javascript
function fetchPatientData(itsId) {
    showLoading(true);
    
    fetch('/accounts/api/lookup-its/', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({ its_id: itsId })
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        if (data.success) {
            showPatientInfo(data.user_data);
            showSuccess('Patient information fetched successfully!');
        } else {
            showError(data.message);
        }
    });
}
```
