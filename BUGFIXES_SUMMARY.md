## ✅ **SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED**

### **🔧 FIX 1: Survey Analytics URL Issue**

**Root Cause**: Dashboard calling `surveys:analytics` without required survey ID parameter.

**Solution**:
- Updated `templates/surveys/dashboard.html` to check for available surveys
- Added conditional logic: `{% if recent_surveys %}`
- Use `recent_surveys.0.id` when surveys exist
- Show disabled button when no surveys available

**Files Modified**:
- `templates/surveys/dashboard.html` (lines 749, 846)

**Code Changes**:
```django
{% if recent_surveys %}
<a href="{% url 'surveys:analytics' recent_surveys.0.id %}" class="action-btn">
{% else %}
<div class="action-btn" style="opacity: 0.5; cursor: not-allowed;">
{% endif %}
```

### **🔧 FIX 2: Survey Questions KeyError**

**Root Cause**: Sample data questions lack `id` field, but code expects `question['id']`.

**Solution**:
- Updated `surveys/views.py` take_survey function
- Use `enumerate()` to generate index-based IDs
- Changed from `question['id']` to `question.get('id', i)`
- Updated template to use `forloop.counter0`

**Files Modified**:
- `surveys/views.py` (line 265)
- `templates/surveys/take_survey.html` (multiple lines)

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Before
for question in questions:
    question_id = str(question['id'])

# After  
for i, question in enumerate(questions):
    question_id = str(question.get('id', i))
```

```django
<!-- Before -->
<input name="question_{{ question.id }}" ...>

<!-- After -->
{% with question_id=forloop.counter0 %}
<input name="question_{{ question_id }}" ...>
{% endwith %}
```

### **🔧 FIX 3: Appointment Functionality**

**Root Cause**: Indentation errors in `create_appointment` function and missing medical services.

**Solution**:
- Fixed indentation and structure in `mahalshifa/views.py`
- Added proper moze assignment logic for different user roles
- Created 8 essential medical services with correct field mapping

**Files Modified**:
- `mahalshifa/views.py` (lines 776-798)

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Fixed indentation and added proper logic
if request.user.role == 'aamil':
    appointment.moze = request.user.managed_mozes.first()
elif request.user.role == 'moze_coordinator':
    appointment.moze = request.user.coordinated_mozes.first()
elif request.user.role == 'badri_mahal_admin':
    appointment.moze = Moze.objects.first()
else:
    appointment.moze = Moze.objects.first()
```

**Medical Services Created**:
- General Consultation (30 min, $50)
- Cardiology Consultation (45 min, $100)
- Neurology Consultation (45 min, $120)
- Emergency Care (60 min, $200)
- Lab Tests (15 min, $30)
