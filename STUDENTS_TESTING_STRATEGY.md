- **MentorshipRequest**: Academic mentoring system
- **AidRequest**: Student support requests
- **StudentMeeting**: Advisory meetings
- **StudentAchievement**: Academic milestones

### Core Views (Expected)
- **dashboard**: Student/admin dashboard with statistics
- **StudentListView**: List all students with filtering
- **CourseListView**: Available courses listing
- **CourseDetailView**: Detailed course information
- **enroll_in_course**: Course enrollment functionality
- **assignment_detail**: Assignment details and submission
- **my_grades**: Student grade reports
- **my_schedule**: Personal class schedules
- **attendance_record**: Attendance tracking
- **student_analytics**: Academic performance analytics
- **export_student_data**: Data export functionality

### URL Patterns (Expected)
```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.dashboard, name='dashboard'),
    path('students/', views.StudentListView.as_view(), name='student_list'),
    path('courses/', views.CourseListView.as_view(), name='course_list'),
    path('course/<int:pk>/', views.CourseDetailView.as_view(), name='course_detail'),
    path('enroll/<int:course_id>/', views.enroll_in_course, name='enroll'),
    path('assignment/<int:pk>/', views.assignment_detail, name='assignment_detail'),
    path('grades/', views.my_grades, name='my_grades'),
    path('schedule/', views.my_schedule, name='my_schedule'),
    path('attendance/', views.attendance_record, name='attendance'),
    path('analytics/', views.student_analytics, name='analytics'),
    path('export/', views.export_student_data, name='export_data'),
]
```

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Admin**: Full access to all student data and management
- **Teacher**: Access to courses, grades, attendance
- **Student**: Access to own data, courses, grades, schedule
- **Staff**: Administrative access for records management

## TESTING PHASES

### Phase 1: Structural Integrity
1. âœ… Verify all model imports work
2. âœ… Check database migrations are applied
3. âœ… Validate model relationships and constraints
4. âœ… Test __str__ methods and model methods

### Phase 2: URL Configuration
1. âœ… Verify all URL patterns resolve correctly
2. âœ… Test URL reversing for all named patterns
3. âœ… Check URL parameter handling
4. âœ… Validate URL namespacing

### Phase 3: View Functionality
1. âœ… Test all view imports and basic accessibility
2. âœ… Verify permission decorators and mixins
3. âœ… Test context data and template rendering
4. âœ… Check form handling and validation

### Phase 4: Role-Based Access
1. âœ… Admin access to all functionality
2. âœ… Teacher access to relevant features
3. âœ… Student access restrictions and permissions
4. âœ… Staff role functionality

### Phase 5: Core Features
1. âœ… Student registration and profile management
2. âœ… Course enrollment and management
3. âœ… Grade tracking and reporting
4. âœ… Attendance recording
5. âœ… Schedule management
6. âœ… Analytics and reporting

### Phase 6: Data Integrity
1. âœ… Test CRUD operations for all models
2. âœ… Verify data validation and constraints
3. âœ… Check foreign key relationships
4. âœ… Test bulk operations and data export

## COMMON ISSUES TO CHECK

### Model Issues
- [ ] Missing __str__ methods
- [ ] Incorrect field types or constraints
- [ ] Broken foreign key relationships
- [ ] Missing or incorrect related_name attributes

### View Issues
- [ ] Incorrect permission checks (is_admin vs role == 'admin')
- [ ] Missing login_required decorators
- [ ] Incorrect queryset filtering
- [ ] Template context issues

### URL Issues
- [ ] Missing or incorrect URL patterns
- [ ] Namespace conflicts
- [ ] Parameter type mismatches

### Template Issues
- [ ] Missing template files
- [ ] Incorrect template references
- [ ] Missing template tags or filters

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

### For 100% Functionality:
1. **All imports successful** (models, views, forms, URLs)
2. **All URL patterns resolve** without NoReverseMatch errors
3. **All views accessible** with appropriate permissions
4. **All CRUD operations work** for core models
5. **Role-based access enforced** correctly
6. **No database integrity errors**
7. **Templates render properly** with correct data
8. **Form validation works** as expected
9. **Analytics and reporting functional**
10. **Export functionality operational**

## EXPECTED TESTING RESULTS

### Target: 95%+ Functionality
- **Excellent (95-100%)**: Ready for production
- **Good (85-94%)**: Minor fixes needed
- **Needs Work (<85%)**: Significant issues require attention

## NEXT STEPS

1. Run comprehensive test script
2. Identify and fix any failing components
3. Apply database migrations if needed
4. Update role-based permission checks
5. Fix template and URL issues
6. Test core functionality end-to-end
7. Commit to main branch when 95%+ achieved
